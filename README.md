# Custom Catalogues and Dressers
(WIP)

This guide assumes you are at least somewhat familiar with using [Content Patcher](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/blob/stable/ContentPatcher/docs/author-guide.md#readme) and modding Stardew Valley in general. I will provide links to the Stardew Valley wiki modding articles where relevant.

Step 1: [Create the item](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Items) that will become the custom catalogue/dresser. Catalogues can technically be anything, but keep in mind what the player can actually interact with as an object in the world (furniture and big craftables are good, but clothing/weapons/tools are pretty much impossible). Dressers _must_ be a dresser furniture item.

Step 2: Use `Action: EditData` to add new entries for each of your catalogues and dressers.

Step 3: ????

Step 4: Profit.
